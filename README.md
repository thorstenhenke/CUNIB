# CUNIB 

The data collection can be conducted via the program CUNIB. The name is based on a German akronym that translates to "Computer assisted classroom observations". Unfortunately CUNIB is -- in its current state --  not very customisable, as it was developed under a very tigh schedule. However the sofware was succesfully used in multiple studies and proofed to be useful.

# Design 
The program is designed around a state machine, which is implemented as a graph.
